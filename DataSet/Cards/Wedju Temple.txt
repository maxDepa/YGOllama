Wedju Temple
Card Type: Spell Card

Description: During your Main Phase: You can place 1 monster from your hand in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell, then place 1 "Millennium" monster from your Deck in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell. You can only use this effect of "Wedju Temple" once per turn. If a face-up "Millennium" monster(s) you control is destroyed by battle or card effect, you can place it in your Spell & Trap Zone as a face-up Continuous Spell, instead of sending it to the GY.

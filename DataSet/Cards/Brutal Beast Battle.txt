Brutal Beast Battle
Card Type: Trap Card

Description: If a player controls 2 or more monsters of the same card type (Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link), they must send some to the GY so they control no more than 1 monster of that card type. Then, each player that sent a monster to the GY for this effect draws cards equal to the number of different card types (Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, or Link) they control. You can only activate 1 "Brutal Beast Battle" per turn.

Orcustrated Core
Card Type: Trap Card

Description: Once per turn: You can banish 1 monster from your field or GY, then target 1 "Orcust" or "World Legacy" card you control, except "Orcustrated Core"; neither player can target it with card effects this turn (even if this card leaves the field). If other "Orcust" and/or "World Legacy" card(s) you control would be destroyed by battle or card effect, you can send this card to the GY instead.

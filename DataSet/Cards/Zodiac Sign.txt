Zodiac Sign
Card Type: Spell Card

Description: All "Zoodiac" monsters you control gain 300 ATK and DEF. Monsters your opponent controls cannot target face-up Beast-Warrior-Type monsters you control for attacks, except the Beast-Warrior-Type monster you control with the highest ATK (either, if tied). Once per turn, if a "Zoodiac" monster(s) you control would be destroyed by card effect, you can destroy 1 monster in your hand or field instead of 1 "Zoodiac" monster.
